# Python-University-Coursework-on-Programming-for-Data-Science-2021-2022
This final year coursework was submitted to the University of London to fulfill the course requirements for module Programming for Data Science.
It is based on the data set retrieved from the Harvard Dataverse website named Data Expo 2009: Airline on time data. Python programming language is used to derive answers relating to flight delays within two years. Different processes such as data wrangling, data exploration, data visualization and machine learning were executed meticulously to further explore and address the problems.
